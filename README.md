The Gateway Mobile Location Centre enables you to offer Location Based Services (LBS) to mobile subscribers in GSM and UMTS network.

In one PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network), there may be more than one GMLC. The GMLC is the first node an external LCS client accesses in a GSM or UMTS network. The GMLC may request routing information from the HLR (Home Location register) or HSS (Home Subscriber Server). After performing registration authorization, it sends positioning requests to either the VMSC (Visited Mobile Switching Centre), SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) or MSC (Mobile Switching Centre) Server and receives final location estimates from the corresponding entity.

GMLC is built on [https://github.com/Mobicents/gmlc](Mobicents jSS7).

GMLC is lead by [http://www.telestax.com](TeleStax, Inc.) and developed collaboratively by a community of individual and enterprise contributors.
