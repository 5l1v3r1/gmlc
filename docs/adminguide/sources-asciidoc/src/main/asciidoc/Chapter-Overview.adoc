= GMLC 

[[_gmlc_overview]]
== Overview

GMLC stands for Gateway Mobile Location Centre enables you to offer Location Based Services (LBS) to mobile subscribers roaming across several Mobile Network Operator's Radio Access Networks, regardless of the type of access (GERAN, UTRAN or E-UTRAN). 

Existing PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) network elements are proprietary and run on non-standard operating environments located in trusted operator's zones which make it difficult to build and deploy new applications. Also, these network elements do not provide the tools and interfaces needed to access and retrieve data from content providers over the Internet. The GMLC connects to these network elements and enables the flow of LCS (Location Services) messages to be extended to an open, standards-based application server (AS) located in the IP network. The AS also provides the tools and interfaces to enable access to content providers through the Internet. 

In one PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network), there may be more than one GMLC. A GMLC is the first node an external LCS client accesses in a PLMN.  

The simplest location information a GMLC can retrieve is by issuing a MAP ATI (Any Time Interrogation) request to the HLR (Home Location register). MAP ATI is part of CAMEL phase 1. If the GMLC is allowed to proceed with the operation at the HLR, the latter will respond with the Cell Global Identity (CGI) as for the latest MAP Update Location operation carried out between the HLR and VLR at which the target mobile equipment is attached too (therefore, an additional parameter known as "Age of Location Information" is also included in the response). As shown in the figure below taken from 3GPP TS 23.003, CGI is made up of multiple components, namely, MCC (Mobile Country Code), MNC (Mobile Network Code), LAC (Location Area Code) and CI (Cell Identity). The combination of MCC and MCC represents the PLMN at which the cell is located, in other words, the country and Mobile Network Operator it belongs to. LAC represents a geographic location area in which a cluster of Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) are located for radio access, while CI, uniquely identifies the BTS providing service to the target subscriber in that area (more commonly known as cell). From CAMEL phase 4 compliance onward, MAP ATI can also retrieve the IMEI and MS Classmark.

CGI represents the location information with greatest error margin retrievable by a GMLC in GSM based core networks. 

From 3G (UMTS) and beyond, more accurate positioning methods were developed for cellular networks. Of course, accuracy comes with a price. When these dearer location capabilities are available, the GMLC may request routing information from the HLR via the Lh interface or HSS (Home Subscriber Server) via the SLh/Lh interface.

While Lh interface reside in a Circuit-Switched Core Network and therefore demands SS7 MAP operations, SLh is placed in the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and is a Diameter-based interface for LTE location services, as specified by 3GPP TS 29.172. After performing registration authorization, it may send positioning requests to either VMSC (Visited Mobile Switching Centre), SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node), MSCS (Mobile Switching Centre Server) or MME (Mobility Management Entity) and receives final location estimates from the corresponding entity via  the Lg, Lgd or SLg interface. Again, Lg/Lgd interfaces demand SS7 MAP operations while SLg is a Diameter-based interface for LTE location occupying ELP procedures, where ELP stands for EPC Location Protocol as specified by 3GPP TS 29.172.

Up to this point, what is known as "Immediate Location Request" has been covered. A GMLC can also handle "Deferred Location Request", which represents retrieving of location contingent on some current or future events where the response from the LCS Server to the LCS Client may occur some time after the request was sent, as described in 3GPP TS 23.271. When a deferred location request is triggered by the GMLC, event-based "Subscriber Location Reports", either conveyed through MAP or ELP are sent back to the GMLC by the entity at which the target mobile equipment is attached to (VMSC, MSCS, SGSN or MME).

Finally, {this-platform} supports the following MAP and Diameter-based operations for LCS (Location Services) within Mobile Network Operators:

* MAP ATI: Any-Time-Interrogation, to gather Cell Global Identity, age of location information and state of the target mobile station from the HLR.
* MAP SRIforLCS: Send Routing Information for Location Services, to gather IMSI and core network entity address (MSC or SGSN) to which send further location request.
* MAP PSL: Provide Subscriber Location, to gather location information from the UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network), which should include, besides Cell Global Identity,  location estimates in geographic coordinates of the target User Equipment, depending on available positioning methods (e.g. E-OTD, OTDOA, UTDOA, A-GPS, etc.).
* MAP SLR: Subscriber Location Report, to gather location of a target User Equipment from the MSC or SGSN when a request for location is either implicitly administered or made at some earlier time in MAP PSL for event based deferred type of location.
* Diameter Routing Information Request/Answer (RIR/RIA): analogous to MAP SRIforLCS but over Diameter based SLh interface between GMLC and HSS.
* ELP Provide Location Request/Answer (PLR/PLA): analogous to MAP PSL but over Diameter-based Evolve Packet Core Location Protocol (ELP) SLg interface between GMLC and MME.
* ELP Location Report Request/Answer (LRR/LRA): analogous to MAP SLR, but over Diameter-based Evolve Packet Core Location Protocol (ELP) SLg interface between GMLC and MME.

== Message Flow

GMLC service begins when the network sends an HTTP (GET/POST) request to the GMLC Gateway.

The message flow involves the following steps:

[[_restcomm_gmlc_overview_features]]
=== Major Features

{this-platform} 's implementation of GMLC Gateway is the first and only open source GMLC Gateway with a host of rich features and advantages. 

Java-based:::
  {this-platform} {this-application} is the only Java based GMLC Gateway.

[[_mobicents_gmlc_overview_http]]
=== HTTP Transfer Mechanism

The {this-platform} makes use of HTTP protocol between the gateway and the third-party applications (or Value Added Service Modules). {this-platform} receives the GMLC request from the third-party applications and then translates these requests to SS7 MAP or Diameter based commands when applies. The HTTP callback mechanism allows the third-party Application to be agnostic to Operating System, Programming Language and Framework.
The third-party Application can be either of the following technologies on any Operating System: 

* Apache Tomcat, JBoss AS, Oracle Application Server, IBM Websphere etc for JSP/Servlet on Java 
* PHP
* Microsoft IIS for ASP
